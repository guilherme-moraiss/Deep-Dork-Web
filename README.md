## Customization
### Adding New Dorks
To add new dorks to the tool:
1. Fork the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Diogo-Lages/Deep-Dork-Web).
2. Open the `dorks.json` file in the forked repository.
3. Add a new entry in the following format:
   ```json
   {
     "query": "site:example.com filetype:pdf {nome}",
     "category": "sensitive data",
     "description": "Searches for PDF files containing the specified keyword on example.com."
   }
   ```
4. Save the file and deploy your forked version using GitHub Pages or another hosting service.

### Modifying the Interface
- **Styling**: Customize the CSS in the `<style>` section of `index.html` to change colors, fonts, or animations.
- **Search Engines**: Add more search engines by modifying the `searchEngines` array in the JavaScript code:

  const searchEngines = [
    { name: 'Google', url: 'https://www.google.com/search?q=' },
    { name: 'Bing', url: 'https://www.bing.com/search?q=' },
    { name: 'DuckDuckGo', url: 'https://duckduckgo.com/?q=' }
  ];
  ```
